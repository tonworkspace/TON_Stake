# 🛡️ Anti-Cheat Staking Security Test

## 🎯 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Database Balance Validation** ✅
- Fetches actual database balance before staking
- Prevents staking with stale local balance data
- Validates against real-time database state

### 2. **Atomic Balance Updates** ✅
- Uses conditional updates to prevent race conditions
- Only updates if balance hasn't changed since check
- Prevents double-spending attacks

### 3. **Rate Limiting** ✅
- 2-second cooldown between stakes
- Prevents rapid-fire staking attempts
- Clear feedback on remaining wait time

### 4. **Loading State Protection** ✅
- Prevents multiple simultaneous staking attempts
- Disables UI during processing
- Prevents button spam

### 5. **Rollback Protection** ✅
- Rolls back balance if stake creation fails
- Maintains data consistency
- Prevents partial state corruption

## 🧪 Security Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Double-Spending Prevention
**Objective:** Verify users cannot stake more than their actual balance

**Steps:**
1. **Deposit 10 TON** to account
2. **Try to stake 15 TON** (more than balance)
3. **Verify error message** appears
4. **Check balance remains unchanged**

**Expected Result:**
```
❌ Error: "Insufficient balance! Available: 10 TON, Required: 15 TON"
✅ Balance stays at 10 TON
```

### Test 2: Race Condition Prevention
**Objective:** Verify rapid staking attempts are blocked

**Steps:**
1. **Deposit 10 TON** to account
2. **Quickly click "Create Stake" multiple times** for 5 TON each
3. **Verify only one stake is created**
4. **Check balance is correctly reduced**

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Only 1 stake created
✅ Balance reduced by exactly 5 TON
✅ Remaining balance: 5 TON
```

### Test 3: Rate Limiting Test
**Objective:** Verify cooldown period works

**Steps:**
1. **Create a stake** (e.g., 2 TON)
2. **Immediately try to create another stake**
3. **Verify cooldown message** appears
4. **Wait 2 seconds and try again**

**Expected Result:**
```
⚠️ Alert: "Please wait 2 seconds before staking again."
✅ After 2 seconds: Can stake again
```

### Test 4: Database Consistency Test
**Objective:** Verify local and database balance stay in sync

**Steps:**
1. **Create a stake** (e.g., 3 TON from 10 TON balance)
2. **Refresh the page**
3. **Check balance is still correct** (should be 7 TON)
4. **Try to stake more than remaining balance**

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Balance shows 7 TON after refresh
❌ Cannot stake more than 7 TON
```

### Test 5: Edge Case Testing
**Objective:** Test boundary conditions

**Test Cases:**
1. **Stake exactly available balance:**
   - Balance: 5 TON, Stake: 5 TON
   - Should succeed, balance becomes 0

2. **Stake 0 TON:**
   - Should be blocked by validation

3. **Stake negative amount:**
   - Should be blocked by input validation

4. **Stake with 0 balance:**
   - Should show "Insufficient balance!"

## 🔍 Console Monitoring

Watch for these security-related logs:

```javascript
// Successful staking with security checks
💰 Balance Update: 10 → 5 (staked: 5)
📊 Stakes Loaded: { totalStakes: 1, userStakes: 1, activeStakes: 1, totalStaked: 5 }

// Security validation
🔒 Database balance validation: 10 TON available
✅ Atomic balance update successful
⏱️ Rate limiting: 2s cooldown set

// Error cases
❌ Insufficient balance! Available: 5 TON, Required: 10 TON
⚠️ Please wait 1 seconds before staking again
❌ Balance changed during staking. Please try again.
```

## 🛡️ Security Features Breakdown

### **Database-Level Protection**
```sql
-- Atomic balance update with condition
UPDATE users 
SET balance = balance - stake_amount
WHERE id = user_id 
AND balance >= stake_amount;  -- Only update if sufficient balance
```

### **Application-Level Protection**
```typescript
// Real-time balance validation
const currentDbBalance = await fetchDatabaseBalance();
if (currentDbBalance < stakeAmount) {
  throw new Error('Insufficient balance!');
}

// Rate limiting
if (now - lastStakeTime < STAKE_COOLDOWN) {
  alert('Please wait before staking again');
  return;
}
```

### **UI-Level Protection**
```typescript
// Loading state prevents multiple clicks
if (isLoading) {
  return; // Prevent multiple simultaneous requests
}

// Button disabled during processing
disabled={isLoading || insufficientBalance}
```

## 🚨 Attack Vectors Prevented

### 1. **Double-Spending Attack** ❌ BLOCKED
- **Attack**: User tries to stake same balance multiple times
- **Prevention**: Database balance validation + atomic updates

### 2. **Race Condition Attack** ❌ BLOCKED
- **Attack**: Rapid-fire staking before balance updates
- **Prevention**: Rate limiting + loading state protection

### 3. **Client-Side Manipulation** ❌ BLOCKED
- **Attack**: User modifies local balance in browser
- **Prevention**: Server-side balance validation

### 4. **Timing Attack** ❌ BLOCKED
- **Attack**: Exploiting timing between balance check and update
- **Prevention**: Atomic conditional updates

### 5. **UI Spam Attack** ❌ BLOCKED
- **Attack**: Clicking stake button rapidly
- **Prevention**: Loading state + rate limiting
