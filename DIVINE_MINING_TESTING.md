# Divine Mining Game - Comprehensive Testing Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Data Reversion Fix Testing

### The Problem
Users reported that when they have mined at least 10k points and reload the page, their points revert back to 4k. This was caused by:
1. **Multiple save systems conflicting** - localStorage, Supabase, and separate keys
2. **Upgrade sync overwriting saved data** - Fresh start logic was too aggressive
3. **Initial load race conditions** - Data was being overwritten during component initialization
4. **Missing timestamp validation** - No conflict resolution between different save sources

### The Fix
✅ **Implemented comprehensive data protection system:**
- Added timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Prevented upgrade sync from overwriting saved data
- Added initial load completion tracking
- Enhanced dual-save system with proper priority
- Added data validation and sanitization
- Implemented comprehensive debug utilities

## 🧪 Testing the Data Reversion Fix

### Test 1: Basic Data Persistence
**Goal:** Verify that points persist after page reload

**Steps:**
1. Open the game and mine until you have at least 10,000 points
2. Note your exact point count
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. Check if your points are preserved

**Expected Result:** ✅ Points should remain the same (no reversion to 4k)

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
// In browser console, check current state
console.log('Current points:', gameState.divinePoints);
console.log('Has loaded saved data:', hasLoadedSavedData);
console.log('Initial load complete:', isInitialLoadComplete);
```

### Test 2: Multiple Reload Test
**Goal:** Verify data persists across multiple reloads

**Steps:**
1. Mine to 15,000+ points
2. Refresh page 5 times
3. Check points after each reload

**Expected Result:** ✅ Points should remain consistent across all reloads

### Test 3: Upgrade Purchase Persistence
**Goal:** Verify upgrades persist after reload

**Steps:**
1. Purchase several upgrades
2. Note your points per second and upgrade count
3. Refresh the page
4. Check if upgrades and mining rate are preserved

**Expected Result:** ✅ Upgrades and mining rate should persist

### Test 4: Offline Progress Test
**Goal:** Verify offline rewards work correctly

**Steps:**
1. Start mining
2. Close the browser tab
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Reopen and check for offline rewards

**Expected Result:** ✅ Should show offline rewards notification

## 🔧 Debug Utilities

### Using the Debug Console
Open browser console and use these commands:

```javascript
// Get comprehensive status report
import { getStatusReport } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
const report = getStatusReport(gameState, upgrades, achievements, user, hasLoadedSavedData, isInitialLoadComplete);
console.log(report);

// Check for NaN values
import { checkForNaN } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
const nanIssues = checkForNaN(gameState, upgrades);
console.log('NaN Issues:', nanIssues);

// Validate save data
import { validateSaveData, debugSaveData } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
const saveData = debugSaveData(user);
const validation = validateSaveData(saveData?.localStorage?.divineMiningState);
console.log('Save Data Valid:', validation);

// Force save all data
import { forceSaveAll } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
await forceSaveAll(gameState, upgrades, achievements, user, saveToSupabase);

// Test save/load cycle
import { testSaveLoadCycle } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
const testResult = await testSaveLoadCycle(gameState, upgrades, achievements, user, saveToSupabase);
console.log('Save/Load Test:', testResult);

// Simulate the 10k to 4k reversion issue
import { simulateDataReversion } from './src/utils/divineMiningDebug';
const simulationResult = await simulateDataReversion(gameState, upgrades, achievements, user, saveToSupabase);
console.log('Reversion Simulation:', simulationResult);
```

### Manual Debug Steps

#### Step 1: Check Current State
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('=== CURRENT STATE ===');
console.log('Divine Points:', gameState.divinePoints);
console.log('Points/Second:', gameState.pointsPerSecond);
console.log('Upgrades Purchased:', gameState.upgradesPurchased);
console.log('Is Mining:', gameState.isMining);
console.log('Has Loaded Saved Data:', hasLoadedSavedData);
console.log('Initial Load Complete:', isInitialLoadComplete);
```

#### Step 2: Check Save Data Sources
```javascript
// Check all localStorage keys
const keys = [
  'divineMiningPoints',
  'divineMiningTotalEarned',
  'divineMiningGame',
  'divineMiningGame_backup',
  `divine_mining_state_${user?.telegram_id}`,
  `divineMiningHighScore_${user?.telegram_id}`
];

keys.forEach(key => {
  const value = localStorage.getItem(key);
  console.log(`${key}:`, value ? JSON.parse(value) : 'null');
});
```

#### Step 3: Check for Data Conflicts
```javascript
// Compare different save sources
const divinePoints = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('divineMiningPoints') || '0');
const mainSave = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('divineMiningGame') || '{}');
const userState = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`divine_mining_state_${user?.telegram_id}`) || '{}');

console.log('=== DATA COMPARISON ===');
console.log('divineMiningPoints:', divinePoints);
console.log('mainSave.divinePoints:', mainSave.divinePoints);
console.log('userState.divinePoints:', userState.divinePoints);
console.log('Current gameState.divinePoints:', gameState.divinePoints);
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Data Still Reverts

#### Check 1: Initial Load Status
```javascript
console.log('Load Status:', {
  hasLoadedSavedData,
  isInitialLoadComplete,
  divinePoints: gameState.divinePoints,
  isFreshStart: gameState.divinePoints === 100 && gameState.pointsPerSecond === 1.0
});
```

#### Check 2: Upgrade Sync Issues
```javascript
// Look for these console messages:
// "🔄 Fresh start detected, applying upgrade calculations"
// "⏭️ Skipping upgrade sync - preserving saved state"
```

#### Check 3: Save System Conflicts
```javascript
// Check if multiple save systems are conflicting
const saveData = debugSaveData(user);
console.log('Save Data Sources:', saveData);
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Points Reset to 100
**Cause:** Fresh start logic triggered incorrectly
**Solution:** Check `hasLoadedSavedData` and `isInitialLoadComplete` flags

#### Issue 2: Points Reset to 4k
**Cause:** Old save data being loaded instead of current data
**Solution:** Clear localStorage and test with fresh data

#### Issue 3: NaN Values
**Cause:** Data corruption during save/load
**Solution:** Use `checkForNaN()` to identify and fix corrupted data

#### Issue 4: Upgrade Loss
**Cause:** Upgrade sync overwriting saved upgrades
**Solution:** Check upgrade sync logic and ensure it only runs on fresh starts

## 📊 Performance Monitoring

### Console Monitoring
Watch for these console messages during testing:

```
✅ Detected valid saved data, setting loaded flag
🔒 Data protection active - preventing reversion
💾 Saved to localStorage: { divinePoints: 15000, timestamp: "..." }
🔄 Starting dual-save system load...
📊 localStorage data is newer, keeping localStorage state
✅ Dual-save system load completed
```

### Error Monitoring
