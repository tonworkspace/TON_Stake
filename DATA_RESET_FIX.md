# üîß Divine Mining Data Reset Fix

## Problem
Users were experiencing data resets where their progress (divine points, mining level, etc.) would be lost when:
- Reloading the page
- After certain game actions
- During save operations

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by overly strict validation in the `validateDivineMiningState` function that would reject any game state with values outside the expected ranges, causing the system to return `null` and trigger a fresh start.

### Original Problematic Code:
```typescript
const validateDivineMiningState = (state: GameState): boolean => {
  // Validate divine points
  if (state.divinePoints < 0 || state.divinePoints > 999999999) {
    return false; // ‚ùå This caused data loss!
  }
  // ... other strict validations
  return true;
};
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Data Recovery Instead of Rejection**
Instead of rejecting invalid data, the system now **recovers and fixes** problematic values:

```typescript
// Validate divine points with recovery
if (state.divinePoints < 0) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Divine points negative, setting to 0');
  state.divinePoints = 0;
  issues.push('divinePoints_negative');
} else if (state.divinePoints > 999999999) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Divine points too high, capping at 999,999,999');
  state.divinePoints = 999999999;
  issues.push('divinePoints_too_high');
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Validation with Debugging**
- Added detailed logging to identify exactly what's causing validation failures
- Each validation step logs what it's checking and what it's fixing
- Security events are logged for monitoring and debugging

### 3. **More Lenient Rate Limiting**
- Rate limiting warnings don't prevent saves anymore
- This prevents data loss due to rapid user interactions

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Critical errors are still logged and handled
- Non-critical issues are recovered from instead of causing resets
- Version increment to track the new recovery system

### 5. **Integrity Check Recovery**
- Data integrity failures trigger warnings instead of complete rejection
- The system attempts to recover and continue rather than reset

## Key Improvements

### **Before (Causing Resets):**
```typescript
if (state.divinePoints < 0 || state.divinePoints > 999999999) {
  return false; // ‚ùå Data lost!
}
```

### **After (Recovery System):**
```typescript
if (state.divinePoints < 0) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Divine points negative, setting to 0');
  state.divinePoints = 0;
  issues.push('divinePoints_negative');
} else if (state.divinePoints > 999999999) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Divine points too high, capping at 999,999,999');
  state.divinePoints = 999999999;
  issues.push('divinePoints_too_high');
}
// Always return true after recovery
return true;
```

## Validation Rules Applied

| Field | Min Value | Max Value | Recovery Action |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| `divinePoints` | 0 | 999,999,999 | Set to 0 if negative, cap if too high |
| `pointsPerSecond` | 0 | 1,000,000 | Set to 0 if negative, cap if too high |
| `currentEnergy` | 0 | `maxEnergy` | Set to 0 if negative, cap at max |
| `maxEnergy` | 100 | No limit | Set to 1000 if too low |
| `miningLevel` | 1 | 100 | Set to 1 if too low, cap at 100 |
| `miningExperience` | 0 | 999,999,999 | Set to 0 if negative, cap if too high |
| `miningCombo` | 1 | No limit | Set to 1 if too low |
| `miningStreak` | 0 | No limit | Set to 0 if negative |
| `miningExperienceToNext` | 100 | No limit | Set to 1000 if too low |

## Testing

A test script has been created at `src/utils/testDataRecovery.ts` to verify the recovery system works correctly with:
- Normal valid data
- Problematic data that needs recovery
- Extreme values that need capping

## Monitoring

The system now logs:
- **Data recovery events** when values are fixed
- **Security events** for monitoring
- **Detailed console logs** for debugging

## Result

‚úÖ **No more data resets** - User progress is preserved even when minor validation issues occur
‚úÖ **Better debugging** - Clear logging shows exactly what's happening during validation
‚úÖ **Maintained game integrity** - Values are still kept within reasonable bounds
‚úÖ **Improved user experience** - No more lost progress due to validation failures

## Version History

- **v2.0**: Original strict validation (causing resets)
- **v2.1**: Enhanced recovery system (fixes data loss)

The fix ensures that user data is preserved while maintaining game balance and providing better debugging capabilities.
