# TBC Coins Referral Display Fix

## 🐛 Issue
Referrals' TBC Coins (divine points from the Divine Mining Game) were not showing in the referral system, showing 0 or incorrect values instead.

## ✅ Solution
Enhanced the referral system to properly fetch, calculate, and display TBC Coins from the Divine Mining Game.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Data Fetching (`src/hooks/useReferralIntegration.ts`)
```typescript
// Now fetches complete game data including TBC coins
const { data: gameData } = await supabase
  .from('user_game_data')
  .select('user_id, divine_points, total_points_earned, mining_level, game_data')
  .in('user_id', friendIds);

// Extracts TBC coins from multiple sources
const tbcCoins = data.divine_points || gameState.divinePoints || 0;
const totalTbcEarned = data.total_points_earned || gameState.totalPointsEarned || 0;
```

### 2. Smart Point Source Detection
The system now prioritizes data sources in this order:
1. **🪙 TBC Coins (Current)** - `divine_points` from mining game
2. **🪙 TBC Coins (Total)** - `total_points_earned` from mining game  
3. **💎 Staking Points** - From TON staking rewards
4. **💰 Stake Potential** - From active stakes
5. **🎯 SBT Tokens** - From SBT balance
6. **🎯 Activity Points** - For new users based on activity

### 3. Enhanced UI Display (`src/components/ReferralSystem.tsx`)

#### TBC Coins Specific Display:
- Shows "TBC" suffix for mining-based points
- Displays mining level and earning rate when available
- Uses gold/orange progress bars for TBC coins vs blue for other points
- Shows point source indicators (🪙 TBC Mining, 💎 Staking, etc.)

#### Smart Progress Bars:
- **TBC Coins**: Dynamic targets (1K → 10K → 100K → 1M)
- **Other Points**: Standard 10K target
- **Color Coding**: Gold for TBC, Blue for others

### 4. Updated TypeScript Interface
```typescript
interface ReferralUser {
  // ... existing fields
  tbcCoins?: number;
  totalTbcEarned?: number;
  pointSource?: 'tbc_current' | 'tbc_total' | 'staking' | 'stake_potential' | 'sbt' | 'activity' | 'new';
  gameData?: any;
}
```

## 🎮 How TBC Coins Are Displayed
