# 🔧 Admin Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up and configure admin access for the Order Management System.

## 🔐 Admin Access Configuration

### Method 1: Database Role-Based Access
Update the users table to include a role column:

```sql
-- Add role column to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user';

-- Set admin users
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3); -- Replace with actual admin user IDs

-- Or set by username
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username IN ('admin', 'owner', 'dev');
```

### Method 2: Permission-Based Access
Add a permissions column to store multiple permissions:

```sql
-- Add permissions column (JSON array)
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS permissions JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Set admin permissions
UPDATE users SET permissions = '["admin", "order_management", "user_management"]' 
WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3);
```

### Method 3: Specific User IDs
Modify the `AdminAccessControl.tsx` component to include specific admin user IDs:

```typescript
const isAdmin = user && (
  user.id === 1 ||  // Replace with your admin user IDs
  user.id === 2 ||
  user.id === 3 ||
  // Add more admin user IDs as needed
);
```

### Method 4: Telegram Username-Based
Allow access based on Telegram usernames:

```typescript
const isAdmin = user && (
  user.username?.toLowerCase().includes('admin') ||
  user.username?.toLowerCase().includes('owner') ||
  user.username?.toLowerCase().includes('dev') ||
  user.username?.toLowerCase() === 'your_admin_username'
);
```

5. **Session Management**: Secure admin sessions and authentication
